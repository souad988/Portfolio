                <h2>About</h2>
                My name is Souad, a Full Stack Software Developer from Morocco. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Distributed Computer Systems from the Faculty of Science and Technologies in Marrakech.

                After completing my studies, I welcomed my third baby ðŸ‘¶, and I decided to prioritize my little one over my career for the next 3 to 4 years. Being available for my children during their early years was crucial, especially when remote work was not as common. Last year, as my child grew a bit older, I decided to re-enter the tech industry. I began by refreshing my coding knowledge, exploring the most in-demand technologies. React and Python stood out as the best choices. I dedicated 3 to 4 months to learning from various platforms, building projects to practice.
                
                Feeling confident in my skills, I started applying for jobs locally. Despite successfully navigating technical interviews, I encountered challenges during behavioral interviews. Recruiters focused more on my availability than my qualifications or productivity. Determined to find opportunities that valued my skills, I delved into remote work, eventually applying to Microverse, an online international school teaching software development through remote pair programming. I was accepted ðŸŽ‰ and embarked on a full-time, 10-month program to hone my technical skills and soft skills crucial for remote team success.
                
                In February 2022, I applied to Outreachy and was delighted to be accepted as an Outreachy intern with the unstructured.studio Team. Through this blog, I share my Outreachy experience, documenting my journey to becoming a remote Full Stack Software Developer. I'll provide valuable tips, insights into technologies, and share my thoughts along the way. Feel free to connect with me through my social links.
